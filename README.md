### Project Description

This is basically a clone of the Evernote lab. The backend is the same and the objective is the same; there's still only one user and you need to set up the create, show, update, and delete functionality for the notes.

I've already set up some code for you in index.js, which you can edit/delete to your liking.

### Notes
* There is a hints.md file in the frontend folder. You can peek at it if you're stuck!
