### Project Description

This is basically a clone of the Evernote lab. The backend is the same and the objective is the same; there's still only one user and you need to set up the create, show, update, and delete functionality for the notes.

I've already set up some event listeners for you in index.js, which you can edit/delete to your liking.

### Requirements
1. DO NOT CHANGE THE CSS AND HTML FILES. This is the only rule. There are no forms in the HTML. Try to create all the forms in your Javascript files. :)
2. There is a hints.md file in the frontend folder. You can peek at it if you're stuck!
